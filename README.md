Subject: Re: Proman progress

Well, we are closing up on Trello so we can go for world domination soon!

You did a decent job on your first sprint of ProMan. The backlog already
contains all our feature requests, I only have one more:

Deploy the app by the end of the sprint, so we can start to promote it!

As last week: send us the sprint backlog ASAP, and we'll meet at the demo!

Remember, quality work is a must, we want to conquer the world with this new product!

Oh and I hope you've learnt from Jacob's mistake about the late arrival to the office...

## What are you going to learn?

- practical usage of AJAX
- mastering web development
- planning the development of an advanced product
- deploying your project

## Tasks

1. Deploy the ProMan project so it is hosted on a server accessible publicly.
    - There is a public URL where we can test the finished product
    - The team uses the public version of the app on the sprint demo

2. Create a new sprint from the existing backlog. Last week you had a long list of stories, only one new story (Deploy ProMan) this week.
    - The new task is added to the backlog
    - Team has created a new sprint plan from the unfinished stories

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- This week you need to continue the work on the same repository as the first part of this project.
